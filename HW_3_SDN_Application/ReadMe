To compile the macTracker.java and the proxyarp.java you would need the Forwarding class.So need to modify the floodlightdefault.properties and net.flooodlightcontroller.core.module.IFloodlightModule.

The other two codes MySimpleSwitch.java and MySimpleFirewall.java would not need the forwarding class.

From the java file you can get to know the package name.
For example:

package net.floodlightcontroller.ProxyARP;

inside this package there exist the class proxyarp class.
